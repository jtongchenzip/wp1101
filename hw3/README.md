#### 2021/10/23

## Requirements
### Basics
1. Only show the input box in the beginning, no todo-list nor footer.
2. After entering text, the item is at the bottom of the list, and the checkbox is unchecked.
3. The checkbox becomes green and the text has decoration effect after clicking on the checkbox. 
4. The checkbox becomes unchecked after clicking on it again.
5. As long as there is more than one item, the footer shows up and displays the number of unchecked items on the left corner.
6. Show `All`, `Active`, `Completed`, and `Clear completed` buttons in the footer.

### Advance
1. `x-image` shows up when hovering on the item.
2. Delete item when clicking on the `x-image`.
3. The number of unchecked items shows the right amount after deleting items.
4. If there is no item in the list, hide the footer.
5. Show all items when clicking on the `All` button.
6. Only show unchecked items when clicking on the `Active` button.
