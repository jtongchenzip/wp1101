####  2021/11/9

## Requirements
### Basics
1. basic operaters: `+, -, *, / `
2. support float
3. exception for divided by 0, overfloat

### Advance
1. `backspace` button
2. `MR` / `MC` button
3. support scientific notation
4. three more function other than basic operaters

## What I've done
1. basic operaters: `+, -, *, /`
2. support float
3. support scientific notation
4. three more function other than basic operaters (`ln`, `+/-`, `%`)
5. can click on operators more than one time

## Improvements
1. can't do operators continuously, has to click `=` before next operation
2. deal with overflow (e.g. `0.3 * 3`)
3. `backspace` button
4. `MR` / `MC` button
5. deal with exceptions
