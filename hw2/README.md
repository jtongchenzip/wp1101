#### 2021/10/17

## Requirements
### Basics
1. visible effect for selected picture
2. visible effect for both selected and clickable pic
3. after clicking clickable pic, the pic has selected effect and is shown in showing area
4. every album has its own photo and preview photos, it's easy for user to know which album is being selected
5. change pictues being presented after changing album
6. make a warning window when chicking on a empty album
7. use open resource images

### Advance
1. Responsive Web Design
2. add, delete albums and pictures
3. make scroll bar when having too many preview photos
4. show the count of pictures and count for each album, also the whcih count is the selected pic 

## What I've done
1. Basics
2. Another empty album, which doesn't have a warning window, can still switch back to normal albums. I think this design is more resonable than the pop out. 
3. Title(Album: ) changes with album name

## Known Bugs
1. In the empty album, the current photo still has a border
2. weird layout when hovering on picture1~4
